				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p>To build something new you have to destroy what you were doing before. That&#8217;s one thing that not enough of us do. Las Vegas does that. They tear down one of their favorite old casinos to make way for something new.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I had to do to my blog. For the past year it felt like a boat anchor wrapped around my neck. It was more and more like work (because, well, it was) and less and less about personal discovery or anything really valuable.</p>
<p>All my fun experiments were over on Twitter, Facebook, or friendfeed. You could see that. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/22/im-sorry-robert-but-its-time-for-a-friendfeed-intervention/">Mike Arrington even tried to do a friendfeed intervention last December</a>. Remember that? Since then I&#8217;ve gotten 14,000 more subscribers over on friendfeed and that service has become dramatically more important as it has gone real time and added on much better search features (are are also way ahead of Facebook&#8217;s and Twitter&#8217;s).</p>
<p>But that is not what I&#8217;m thinking about.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve been doing for the past two months since joining Rackspace is going back to the basics. What makes me excited?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve visited dozens of companies, gone to a bunch of events, and, more importantly, I started playing with my blog again.</p>
<p>First off I went through every line of HTML and PHP so that I understood what was going on inside Wordpress again. I hadn&#8217;t done that for years. Second, we moved my blog over to a Wordpress install hosted on Rackspace&#8217;s Cloud Servers, aka Mosso.</p>
<p>That freed my mind because now I could try out server plugins and also widgets on my blog. For instance, you&#8217;ll see in the comments here we&#8217;re using Disqus so that your comments will integrate over to friendfeed in near real time. I&#8217;m not settled on Disqus, over the next couple of weeks we&#8217;ll look at the others too. There&#8217;s a lot of innovation happening there.</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m playing with location-based services. You&#8217;ll see Google&#8217;s Latitude widget over on the right side of my blog, underneath the friendfeed one. I&#8217;ll be adding more widgets over the next few weeks too.</p>
<p>Oh, and also over the last couple of months I&#8217;ve been slowly working with various folks at Rackspace. After I played with the HTML here, Vid Luther took over, talked me into using a new theme, <a href="http://diythemes.com/thesis/">Thesis</a>, and then integrated Facebook Connect in here and also did some other work to get my blog up to 2010 standards.</p>
<p>Now, you might think my new blog isn&#8217;t &#8220;visual&#8221; enough. I don&#8217;t have a picture of myself. No fancy logo or graphic banner. Those might come in the future. For me my blog isn&#8217;t about me anymore anyway. That&#8217;s more what my friendfeed set of feeds is (which is why friendfeed plays such a big part in my new design). Friendfeed aggregates my tweets, my Flickr photos, my videos, and much more together. Plus, via <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/likes">my likes</a> and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer/comments">my comments</a> you can see what stuff I&#8217;m reading and what catches my eye.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to what I&#8217;m doing now for Rackspace: I&#8217;m exploring what it means to be a 2010 website. I&#8217;ve been visiting tons of businesses and there&#8217;s a lot of businesses out there that don&#8217;t even have a web site, or if they have one, it looks like it was built in 1994. </p>
<p>In a couple of weeks I&#8217;m getting a new <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/">2010 Toyota Prius</a>. If you look at the web site, it seems to be pretty cool, right? But why doesn&#8217;t Toyota have a community, or place you can go to talk about the 2010 Prius? <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/TOYOTA/14156599521?sid=610abd2c6453fade1af9389e192dc02f&#038;ref=search">Toyota does have a Facebook page</a>, but why didn&#8217;t they create a place for me to go to talk about my new Prius with other people? Why didn&#8217;t it create a YouTube account that would get hooked in here? Did you know that <a href="http://twitter.com/toyotanewsroom">Toyota&#8217;s PR team is on Twitter</a>? Yeah, they are, but you wouldn&#8217;t have known by looking at the Toyota Web site. Even over on Twitter and Google it took quite a few tries to find this page.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m getting at. Toyota is one of the world&#8217;s top brands. Has TONS of money to spend on marketing. And they aren&#8217;t even taking advantage of the 2010 web. So how are smaller businesses supposed to do it?</p>
<p>For instance, right near Facebook is an awesome yogurt shop named <a href="http://www.fraicheyogurt.com">Fraiche</a>. Tons of Facebook employees frequent here. So you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be working on a Facebook connect site so that they can let their community know when they have something new to offer, right? No. </p>
<p>Do they use video to tell their story? No. Do they have a friendfeed group where people who love Fraiche can talk about it? No. Is there a blog that shows some of the new things they are adding? No.</p>
<p>This is a business that&#8217;s run by the wife of a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and is right in the heart of Palo Alto (a short walk away is Tapulous and Facebook). If they aren&#8217;t on the 2010 web, something is wrong.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve taken time to watch what the tech blogs are doing (I spent some time in TechCrunch&#8217;s offices this week) I see that we&#8217;ve forgotten about the mainstreet businesses.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve gotten so far ahead with our social media toys that we&#8217;ve forgotten about the many many businesses that still have web sites that look like they were designed in 1994-2000. Even the Toyota site doesn&#8217;t really have much on it that wasn&#8217;t possible before 2005 (with the exception of some high resolution video). </p>
<p>The world has changed in the last four years and businesses, I&#8217;m convinced, will need to react to this new &#8220;2010&#8243; world. It might take them until 2015 to really get on board, but I want to help now.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do here. Focus on the 2010 web and how we can help businesses get there. That&#8217;s also what we&#8217;ll be doing over on <a href="http://www.building43.com">Building43</a>. By the way, we&#8217;ll be launching that sometime in June, sorry for being a little quiet about that. Turns out that building a community from scratch and figuring out a direction takes some time to just sit and think.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, Scoble, so what are you learning about the 2010 web so far?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m seeing it has a few attributes:</p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s real time. Twitter, Facebook and Friendfeed are all moving toward architectures and displays that refresh in real time, or let you see what&#8217;s happening right now. We are at the extreme beginnings of that trend. You really should watch the video of the panel discussion I moderated on the state of real time search to get a sense of where this is going. That panel discussion will be remembered for years as a key point. One of the panel members runs Facebook search team. Yes, Facebook is working on real time search. (That video is in two parts since the meeting ran almost two hours long. I really do recommend watching it. <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/6118-scobleizer/438176-real-time-web-search-at-sdforum">Part I is here</a>. <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/6118-scobleizer/438482-part-ii-real-time-search">Part II is here</a>.).<br />
2. It&#8217;s mobile. You&#8217;ll see this more next week when the Where 2.0 conference rolls into town, but if 40,000 iPhone apps hasn&#8217;t convinced you yet, nothing will. On Monday I&#8217;m meeting with Nokia to find out the latest.<br />
3. It&#8217;s decentralized. Look at my behaviors. I&#8217;m all over the place. Six years ago I did only one thing: blog. Now I Flickr. YouTube. Seesmic. Friendfeed. Facebook. Twitter. And many more. Go to <a href="http://www.retaggr.com/Page/scobleizer/">Retaggr </a>and see all the places I&#8217;m at.<br />
4. Pages now built out of premade blocks. You build these pages by copying a line of Javascript code to your template. This is very simple once you see how to do it, but for someone who doesn&#8217;t know code, or where in the template to go, this is VERY daunting. Silicon Valley has NOT made it simple enough yet for the mainstream to build highly useful pages. See the friendfeed block to the right of my words? I added that by copying and pasting from the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/embed">friendfeed widget page</a>. If you know where to look a TON of cool pre-built blocks like this are available for you to put on your website or blog.<br />
5. It&#8217;s social. This seems obvious to anyone on Twitter or Facebook, but how many businesses add their customers to their pages? Not many. Silicon Valley has done a horrible job so far of explaining why adding people to your websites matters.<br />
6. It&#8217;s smart. We&#8217;re seeing more and more smarts added to the web every day. Tonight Wolfram&#8217;s new search engine turned on. Have you played with it? That&#8217;s the 2010 web and<a href="http://searchengineland.com/wolframalpha-the-un-google-19296"> check out what you can do with it</a>.<br />
7. Hybrid infrastructure. When I visited <a href="http://12seconds.tv">12seconds.tv</a> in Santa Cruz they told me they were using a hybrid approach: they own a rack of servers but they also use Amazon&#8217;s S3 to &#8220;cloud burst&#8221; or take up the slack for files that are popular. My employer <a href="http://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a> will have more to say about that trend too over the next few months.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m off to New York this week. I&#8217;m meeting with <a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a> to see what he thinks is happening in the 2010 web. Anyone else got something that will push the web into 2010?</p>
<p>PR People: <a href="http://friendfeed.com/pitchscoble">I even made a place you can pitch me on 2010 web ideas</a>. It&#8217;s interesting that a bunch of people are subscribed to that room &#8212; probably lots of tech bloggers looking for ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with me while I destroyed my blog, now let&#8217;s have some fun together!</p>
<p>Oh, last weekend <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/1486821">I videoed Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, as he got onto friendfeed</a> (<a href="http://friendfeed.com/jimmywales">his new account is here</a>). That&#8217;s a fun video too that you might find useful (the first couple minutes have bad video, but it gets better after that). He even admitted to me that Wikipedia is not a good example of a 2010 website and that they are going to be rolling out new features that will make it much more up to date. Can&#8217;t wait to see that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to bed. Yes, I typed this all after midnight tonight. That&#8217;s another thing, no more pre-done packaged crap here.</p>

<p>&#8230;is that if you don&#8217;t like the theme you picked yesterday you can change it with a click of the mouse today. This is NOT my new design. It&#8217;s yet another way I can mess with the &#8220;brand&#8221; I&#8217;ve built. I want to destroy it, to allow me to play around and find something fresh. How&#8217;s this one? Anyway, today I&#8217;m on a plane to Phoenix to hang out with some cool geeks. More later as we continue building this out.</p>
<p>This theme is one of the pre-built ones in Wordpress.com. If you don&#8217;t like it, we can pick another and keep trying them as Rackspace&#8217;s designers work on my new design, which will come up as part of the launch of <a href="http://www.building43.com">Building43</a>, the community for people fanatical about the Internet comes alive.</p>

				<div class="format_text entry-content">
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> has done something really remarkable: they have made the entire database of Tweets available to other companies. My favorite <a href="http://beta.friendfeed.com">friendfeed</a> is one of the beneficiaries of that &#8220;firehose&#8221; of data. You can watch my Tweets go from Twitter to friendfeed and back again. Oh, and friendfeed makes its firehose available to Twitter in return. You can see how this benefits both services. My liked items go from friendfeed to Twitter.</p>
<p>Now, what did Facebook do today? Well, <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=225">it turned on an open stream API</a> so that developers can put things into the stream over on Facebook. It also looks like developers can take some data off of the stream and use it in their own applications.</p>
<p>Loic Le Meur, CEO of Seesmic, <a href="http://beta.friendfeed.com/loic/e6f86424/seesmic-desktop-gets-full-facebook-open-stream">has already shipped a version of Seesmic that does just that</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/despite_new_openness_facebook_remains_fundamentall_1.php">One big problem that Marshall Kirkpatrick, over at the ReadWriteWeb points out</a>: Facebook is still keeping most of its users&#8217; data private due to the privacy contract that it has made with its users. See, over on Twitter and friendfeed the bias for most user data is that it is public by default until you make it private (like, in friendfeed, you would have to open a room and make that explicitly private to be able to keep your data from going over to Twitter and over to Google. On Facebook it&#8217;s the opposite. If you use Facebook as designed your data only gets shown to your friends, not anyone else).</p>
<p>This is a HUGE difference between the openess of the Twitter/friendfeed model and the Facebook one.</p>
<p>Go see the comments <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/despite_new_openness_facebook_remains_fundamentall_1.php">on Marshall&#8217;s post</a>. They are very telling about how poorly people understand what&#8217;s going on here and how they can articulate what they want.</p>
<p>The real elephant in the room is &#8220;where&#8217;s the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>The real money is in search. Yeah, I&#8217;m sure that someone at Facebook this afternoon will point out they are selling lots of display ads because they know their audience demographics pretty damn well (hint: Facebook knows EVERYTHING about who you are. I told it, for instance, that I&#8217;m a male 44-year-old democrat who loves skiing and photography, among other things).</p>
<p>But the REAL money has NOT shown up for Zuckerberg and crew yet. What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p>Search.</p>
<p>When I can ask Facebook &#8220;what sushi restaurants do my friends like?&#8221; ONLY THEN will you know that Facebook is getting close to the gold mine.</p>
<p>The thing is, Facebook doesn&#8217;t want to let you build that kind of business using its data.</p>
<p>THAT is reason #2 why Facebook isn&#8217;t going to turn on its real firehose for friendfeed to study, the way that Twitter has let friendfeed have access.</p>
<p>Reason #1, though, is that Zuckerberg hasn&#8217;t yet figured out how to change user expectations from having everything private by default to having everything public by default, the way Twitter and friendfeed work.</p>
<p>In an hour a group of us will be meeting with Facebook executives. If everything works out you&#8217;ll be able to follow along at http://live.twit.tv as part of a special Gillmor Gang at about 4 p.m. Pacific Time. I&#8217;ll definitely try to figure out how Facebook will change the default mode so that it can turn on the business social graph.</p>
<p>I also will find out if there&#8217;s a roadmap to opening up the data stream to include more data leakage outside of Facebook. If I were Zuckerberg I wouldn&#8217;t open that up until after I could change user expectations and get people to build a public instance of themselves. That could take a couple of years.</p>
<p>I wonder what you think of Facebook&#8217;s moves? Join us on the Gillmor Gang and over on friendfeed (<a href="http://beta.friendfeed.com/scobleizer/4bf5e34b/facebook-still-data-roach-motel-when-compared">we&#8217;re having a live chat about this post over on the beta friendfeed</a>) and let&#8217;s see if we can learn something together about where Facebook is headed.</p>
<p>UPDATE: friendfeed cofounder Paul Buchheit <a href="http://beta.friendfeed.com/scobleizer/4bf5e34b/facebook-still-data-roach-motel-when-compared">just wrote this over on the live chat</a>: &#8220;It&#8217;s not about defaults, it&#8217;s about ownership. On Facebook, you are not allowed to give other people access to your data, because your data belongs to Facebook. On FriendFeed or Twitter, you can choose to be public or private, but either way you can still access your data and do what you want with it.&#8221;</p>
